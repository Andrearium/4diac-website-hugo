## Documentation, Marketing, and Supporting new Users
- Improve and extend the existing documentation
- Write new tutorials
- Support the forums: Answer questions in the different forums
- Spread the word: link to 4diac, use 4diac logo on your web page, write articles, blog entries, etc.

## Bug Wrangling and Testing 
- Find and report bugs to ensure the quality of 4diac.
- Submit ideas for improvement via [4diac's Bugzilla](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/enter_bug.cgi?product=4DIAC)
- Review and verify [reported bugs](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/buglist.cgi?list_id=13385396&product=4DIAC&query_format=advanced). Sometimes there is not enough info attached to a bug report or it is hard to reproduce. Trying to reproduce a bug and extending the description is of great value.
- Rate Bugs, feature requests, and ideas. This helps that we can focus our limited resources on the most important elements first.

## Development 
If you are a developer feel free to grab the code and start hacking. You can submit your patch any time when you are ready.
- Extend and improve FB library. Having a large set of FBs increases the usability of 4diac for developing control solutions.
- For ideas where to start your effort have a look at the bugs and features submitted to the [4diac's issue tracker](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/buglist.cgi?list_id=13385396&product=4DIAC&query_format=advanced)
- For getting started feel free to ask questions in the [4diac discussion forum](http://eclipse.org/forums/eclipse.4diac) and in [4diac's mailing list](https://dev.eclipse.org/mailman/listinfo/4diac-dev)
- A detailed description on how to contribute code to Eclipse 4diac can be found in our [contribution guide](en_help.php?helppage=html/development/contribute.html)
